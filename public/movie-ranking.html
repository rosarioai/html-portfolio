<h1>The Best Movies According to Xavier</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Top Gun Maverick</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie of all time. I can watch it over and over and it never gets old.</p>

<h3>The Social Network</h3>
<p>This movie explains how Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook. It very interesting and you also learn things like how to start a tech company.</p>

<h3>Outerbanks</h3>
<p>This is not a movie, it's a TV Show, but its worth mentioning because of how amazing it is.</p>
